		<h1>Welcome to SimpleCrypt.js</h1>
		<p>SimpleCrypt.js is a simple way to make sure that ONLY the people you WANT to read your messages CAN. It works through an age old, proven manual plaintext encryption technique (this will be detailed further in the final application). For maximum security, we recommend that you turn off your internet connection BEFORE clicking the button below (although we can NEVER see what text you enter, as it is stored by your browser and not by us, that does not mean that the machine you are using has not been compromised). Furthermore, we recommend using Mozilla FireFox web browser rather than Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, or any other popular browser, due to its open-source and secure nature. To begin, simply click the button below and enter a codeword with no duplicate letters and all in lower case, then enter your message and click OK.</p>
